#  Introduction

This is a collection of the projects in working progress or completed within the last few months.

## Dollar neutral portfolio optimisation based on financial statement and news sentiment analyses</sup>[*](#Note)</sup>
Scraped and modeled 1.5 million documents  (annual and quarterly compliance reports to the Security Exchange Commission and real time financial news on reputable news media) on an universe of American Deposit Receipts listings on NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange. Used a large variety of natural language processing, unsupervised learning, deep supervised learning, reinforcement learning and constraint optimization techniques. Project currently undergoing rigorous back-testing, preliminary results indicative of consistent 25% annual return on fully hedged investment portfolio.

These notebooks outline how to scrape and process SEC data from: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml)
for sentiment analysis 

## Autism fMRI neuroimaging (functional connectome mapping using computer vision and deep learning)</sup>[**](#Note)</sup>

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a permanent brain-based disorder characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors that is currently diagnosed at the rate of 1 in every 68 children. Various state-of-art applied machine learning algorithms were applied to identify autism spectrum disorder patients from a world-wide multi-site database known as Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. Patterns of functional connectivity that objectively identify autism from functional brain imaging data were investigated to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from unsupervised classification. Results achieved 70% accuracy in identification of autism versus control patients, patterns that emerged from the classification show an anticorrelation of brain function between anterior and posterior areas of the brain, which corroborates anterior-posterior disruption in brain connectivity as documented in the latest empirical medical studies.
