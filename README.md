#  Introduction

This is a collection of the projects in working progress or completed within the last 2 months.

## Financial Analysis notebooks </sup>[*](#Note)</sup>

These notebooks outline how to scrape and process SEC data from:

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml)

for sentiment analysis 

## R-fMRI Analysis</sup>[**](#Note)</sup>

Downloading and processing of resting state functional magnetic resonance images data via the [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) python module makes it easy to download and setup processing pipelines for fMRI data. I have chosen to look at the [ABIDE(Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange)](https://github.com/OpenXAIProject/Preprocessed_ABIDE_Dataset). Dataset 1 contains 1112 dataset, including 539 from individuals with ASD and 573 from typical controls (ages 7-64 years, median 14.7 years across groups).  

##  Privacy preserving Machine Learning

Introductory notebooks from the Udemy course about machine learning that preserves the security of data.

See the
